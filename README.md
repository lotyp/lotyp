Welcome to my GitHub profile üëã

With over 20 years of experience in IT, I blend technical expertise with business insights.
I started my journey at 13, and since then, I've worked across various IT sectors.

As the founder of the [wayof.dev](https://github.com/wayofdev) GitHub organization and a member of the [Buggregator](https://github.com/buggregator) and [Cycle](https://github.com/cycle) organizations, my passion lies in open-source development, automation, and experimenting with LLMs and AI.
